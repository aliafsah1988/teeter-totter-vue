# teeter-totter-vue
A teeter-totter game created by vue.js

## How to use
1. Intall project packages with:
```bash
npm i
```
2. Run the project
```bash
npm run serve
```

## How to play
With left and right arrows on your keyboard, try to navigate the falling objects on the teeter-totter bar. You should try to keep that balanced!
Note: Based on physics lows! if you put the object far from base (in our case center) it will have more effect on the balance and in opposite if it's closer to the base, it has less impact.
